- 👋 Hi, I’m Dheeraj Tupe,
- 👀 I’m interested in working on and learning about new things in ADAS & Autonomous vehicles. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on building my profile and showcasing some of my projects which I have worked on in past during my college days and would also be              uploading some of my personal projects which I have done during my learning phase.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects related to Autonomous Vehicles, be it sensor fusion, path planning, decision making, Controls, etc. Can work on them          all.
- 📫 You can reach me on Linkedin : www.linkedin.com/in/dheeraj-tupe-b42964140 or send me a mail on : drtupe@gmail.com.
